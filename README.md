# About Project
**Farmer's Friend**<br>
This system will give support to fruitful farming.<br>
First of all this system has two parts.<br>

1)Hardware : **Nutritions Data Collector**<br>
    →We will use it to measure neutrisions from different parts of field and put a **signboard of no.** to there.(to get specific name to that area)<br>
    →This Hardwear is IOT based so,The data will be directly sent to the server.<br>
2)Software : **Crop Predictor**<br>
    →Now our app/website will analyze the data(get through Hardwear) and check for suitable crops according to the weather(that is given by Farmer).<br>

→When a farmer selects a crop then our program will help him to give suggestions for nutritions that should be added to specific parts of the field for better growth of crops.<br>
→The Farmer can go through the whole procedure the 2nd time after he/she starts farming the crop to get continuous knowledge of soil and guidelines for fertilizing the soil.

**WEBSITE LINK:point_down:**<br>
https://sites.google.com/view/friend2farmers/

we have created this site in the Google Sites;
This website contains 3 pages:<br>
1st page :It's Home Page and Contain some Information regarding our site;<br>
2nd page :This page contain the Soil Fertility Analysis and Guidelines;<br>
3rd page :This page contain the Crop Prediction Procedure;<br>

**Working of Fertility and Guidelines :** We don't know how to generate the report so we take help of graphical representation through Graph of what we are guiding and what we have analysed.In this,First of all we have assumed that there is a IOT based devices which will take soil Fertility data and send it to google sheets.The google sheet will generate the graph of it and start analyzing in this phase we took particular average of the factors and check for is the value of factor is less than average for a particular part then we will guide the farmer to add that factor of fertility to that part of farm through fertilizer.

# Introduction of Developer Team
We are the pre final year students of BVM.We are from electronics background.We don't have much idea regarding website or app development but We have tried to make one website for farmers we know that it's can be improve and we will definitely do it in future.yes we also don't know how to use this platform to upload projects because we rarely use this platform.But for now we follow **just do it....**
