For the System 
#**Farmer's Friend**<br>
This system will give support to fruitful farming.<br>
First of all this system has two parts.<br>

1)Hardware : **Nutritions Data Collector**<br>
 →We will use it to measure neutrisions from different parts of field and put a **signbord of no.** to there.(to get specific name to that area)<br>
 →This Hardwear is IOT based so,The data will be directly sent to the server.<br>
2)Software : **Crop Predictor**<br>
→Now our app/website will analyze the data(get through Hardwear) and check for suitable crops according to the weather(that is given by Farmer).<br>

→When a farmer selects a crop then our program will help him to give suggestions for nutritions that should be added to specific parts of the field for better growth of crops.<br>
→The Farmer can go through the whole procedure the 2nd time after he/she starts farming the crop to get continuous knowledge of soil and guidelines for fertilizing the soil.
