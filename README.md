# About Project
**Farmer's Friend**<br>
This system will give support to fruitful farming.<br>
First of all this system has two parts.<br>

1)Hardware : **Nutritions Data Collector**<br>
    →We will use it to measure neutrisions from different parts of field and put a **signbord of no.** to there.(to get specific name to that area)<br>
    →This Hardwear is IOT based so,The data will be directly sent to the server.<br>
2)Software : **Crop Predictor**<br>
    →Now our app/website will analyze the data(get through Hardwear) and check for suitable crops according to the weather(that is given by Farmer).<br>

→When a farmer selects a crop then our program will help him to give suggestions for nutritions that should be added to specific parts of the field for better growth of crops.<br>
→The Farmer can go through the whole procedure the 2nd time after he/she starts farming the crop to get continuous knowledge of soil and guidelines for fertilizing the soil.

1st page :it's Home Page and contain some information regarding this site;<br>
2nd page :This page contain the soil fertility analysis and gudelines;<br>
3rd page :This page contain the Crop pridiction proseger;<br>

**working of fertility and guidelines :** we dont know how to generate the report so we take help of graphical representation through Graph of what we are guiding and what we have analysed.in this firt of all we have asumed that there is a IOT based devise which will take sooil fertility data and send it to google sheets.the google sheet will generate the graph of it and start analysing in this phase we took perticular average of the facors and check for is the value of factor is less then average for a perticular part then we will guide to farmer to add that factor of fertility to that part of farm through fertilizer.
