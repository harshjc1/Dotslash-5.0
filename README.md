For the System **Farmer's Friend**
This system will give support to fruitful farming.
First of all this system has two parts.
1)Hardware : **Nutritions Data Collector**
 →We will use it to measure neutrisions from different parts of field and put a **Indicator of no.**
 →This Hardwear is IOT based so,The data will be directly sent to the server.

2)Software : **Crop Predictor**
→Now our app/website will analyze the data(get through Hardwear) and check for suitable crops according to the weather(that is given by Farmer).

→When a farmer selects a crop then our program will help him to give suggestions for nutritions that should be added to specific parts of the field for better growth of crops.

→The Farmer can go through the whole procedure the 2nd time after he/she starts farming the crop to get continuous knowledge of soil and guidelines for fertilizing the soil.
