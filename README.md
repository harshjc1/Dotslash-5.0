# Introduction of developer team :
We are the pre final year students of BVM.We are from electronics background.we don't have much idea regarding website or app development but we have tried to make one website for farmers we know that it's can be improve and we will definitely do it in future.yes we also don't know how to use this platform to upload projects because we rarely use this platform.But for now we  follow **just do it....**  

# About The Project :
**Farmer's Friend**<br>
As per name this is a project for farmers.This project will give support to fruitful farming. what is we means that we see sometimes there is in some part of farm the yield is good as compared to other parts,farmer use the same fertilizers on whole field but yield is differ, so here is some solution we thought that there must be some issues with difference of minerals in soil so that can be happen that our crop get different nutritions from soil due to this differness in minerals now onwards we call them factor of fertility.what we are doing here is analys your fertility of soil and give you a report regarding your current situation of soil as well as what you should do now to level this fertility factors.<br>
this program will help farmers to choose the crop for plantation,just by giving the season information.we already know his/her soil fertility level so we suggest the crop according to this

**the work flow**
First of all this system has two parts.<br>
1)Hardware : **Nutritions Data Collector**<br>
    →We will use it to measure neutrisions from different parts of field and put a **signboard of no.** to there.(to get specific name to that area)<br>
    →This Hardwear is IOT based so,The data will be directly sent to the server.<br>
2)Software : **Crop Predictor**<br>
    →Now our app/website will analyze the data(get through Hardwear) and check for suitable crops according to the weather(that is given by Farmer).<br>

→When a farmer selects a crop then our program will help him to give suggestions for nutritions that should be added to specific parts of the field for better growth of crops.<br>
→The Farmer can go through the whole procedure the 2nd time after he/she starts farming the crop to get continuous knowledge of soil and guidelines for fertilizing the soil.

# implemented project :

**WEBSITE LINK:point_down:**<br>
https://sites.google.com/view/friend2farmers/

we have created this site in the Google Sites;
This website contains 3 pages:<br>
1st page :it's Home Page and contain some information regarding this site;<br>
2nd page :This page contain the soil fertility analysis and guidelines;<br>
3rd page :This page contain the Crop prediction procedure;<br>

**working of fertility and guidelines :** we don't know how to generate the report so we take help of graphical representation through Graph of what we are guiding and what we have analysed.in this first of all we have assumed that there is a IOT based devices which will take soil fertility data and send it to google sheets.the google sheet will generate the graph of it and start analyzing in this phase we took particular average of the factors and check for is the value of factor is less than average for a particular part then we will guide to farmer to add that factor of fertility to that part of farm through fertilizer.

**working of Crop prediction :** we have data related to the seasons and fertility of the different crops.by taking the season data from farmer we have to choose the list of crops that the farmer should plant to his farm to get good yield.But as we mentioned earlier we don't have any prior knowledge of making website or how to connect this and generate report.

# Future Work :
First of all we update(as we mentioned in 'about this project') this site with the help of some web developing team :laughing::laughing:.we also going to built our own IOT device to collect the data of soil(It's our kinda work!!Electronics stud :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye::sunglasses:).<br>
This whole Program can be updated by an ML based weather prediction system and analysis of near market yards where farmers often go to sell crops.<br>
→ Weather prediction system will predict weather and generate data of nearly 1.5 Month when crop condition is very critical for the crop.<br>
→ Market analysis will help farmers to give suggestions when they should go to the yard to sell his crop to get good money.
